# Appendix-A-Detailed-Competitor-Profiles
This appendix provides the depth investors will want during due diligence. I've created comprehensive profiles for key players in each cluster, analyzing their business models, pricing structures, strengths, and limitations.
This appendix provides the depth investors will want during due diligence. I've created comprehensive profiles for key players in each cluster, analyzing their business models, pricing structures, strengths, and limitations. What makes this particularly valuable is that each profile explicitly identifies why that competitor cannot easily replicate RootRise's model. For instance, McKinsey can't scale down to €2,500/month without destroying their entire economic model, while Zoho can't add embedded humans without compromising the software margins their valuation depends on.
